Tafl is a board game for J2ME phones. Tafl-type games are chess-like
games and were played in northern europe during the middle ages. See
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tafl for a description of these games and
the rules of play.

You can play both against the computer (which is fairly stupid as of
now) or against a human friend.

The game is released under the GNU GPL, see the file COPYING for more
information.
